## Overview

This project documents the analysis of a custom banking trojan discovered in a honeypot environment.

## Tools Used

- **Ghidra** - Binary disassembly and decompilation
- **IDA Free** - Advanced static analysis
- **API Monitor** - Dynamic API hooking
- **Wireshark** - Network traffic analysis
- **YARA** - Malware signature creation

## Key Findings

### Functionality
- Command & Control (C2) communication via HTTPS
- Credential stealing from web browsers
- Persistence mechanism via Registry

### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
- File Hash: `a1b2c3d4...`
- C2 Domain: `suspicious-domain.com`
- Network signature: Port 8443 with custom TLS

## Artifacts Discovered

The malware stored encrypted credentials at:
```
%APPDATA%\Local\Temp\cache.bin
```

## Mitigation

- Block C2 domain at firewall
- Create YARA rule for detection
- Update security tools signatures
